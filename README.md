# Mod-8-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room client is a puzzle game that's used for multiple people to play. The client, Creative Technology Solutions, wanted a software that was viable for multiple operating systems via web.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

When developing the document, I felt I did well on the recommendations. I was able to clarify what was needed for the OS and distributed systems. The architectures was a bit confusing to me, but after some research I was able to complete it.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

When developing code, the document help me stay organized. I was able to see what I needed, and if something needed updated, I was able to use the document to process what needed done where.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

When choosing one part to revise, I'd want to revise the Design Constraints. I feel like there's little information in this section, and I'm use to a bullet point type of constraint where everything is clear on what I do and don't do. When improving this, I'd like to check into more of what I need to do, and what is necessary overall rather than the minimal constraints.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's need as a software that's able to be used via web for multiple operating systems. Creative Technology Solutions wanted to build a larger client than solely Andriod, and the web allows for a platform that doesn't require much for the different operating systems that CTS is looking for.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When approaching the designing software, I went through it from the easiest to hardest. I started with the summary, the design constraints, and then the domain model. After that, I worked on the evaluation and the recommendations. Once this was finished, I went through and did the rest of the document that I've missed. In the future, I'll design a similar software application with the most important information necessary first with documentation, and add any extra information that's needed to be added with the design.
